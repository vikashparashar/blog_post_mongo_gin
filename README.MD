# The task at hand is to create a blog application API using the Gin web framework (https://gin-gonic.com/) and golang mongo driver (https://www.mongodb.com/docs/drivers/go/current/) as the database.

## The project requirements are as follows:

1. Implement CRUD APIs for the blog feature, including creating a new blog post, reading a single blog post, reading all blog posts, updating a blog post, and deleting a blog post.
2. Implement an authentication system to restrict the ability to create, update, and delete blog posts to only users with admin privileges. 
3. Only admins should be able to create, update, and delete blog posts, while regular users should only be able to view them.
4. Create admin user credentials to seed the database during initialization, rather than through a signup process.
5. Adhere to best practices for writing maintainable and scalable code, including proper use of Go's concurrency features and error handling.
6. Ensure that the code is well-structured, maintainable, easy to understand, and properly documented where necessary.
